# Exercise 3: Data Frame Practice with `dplyr`.
# Use a different appraoch to accomplish the same tasks as exercise-1


# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('dplyr')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)
library(dplyr)
# Which Acura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (without method chaining)
View(vehicles)
acura.2015 <- filter(vehicles, make == 'Acura', year == 2015)
acura.2015.best <- filter(acura.2015, hwy == max(hwy))
acura.2015.bes5.answer <- select(acura.2015.best, hwy)
# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (nesting functions)


# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (pipe operator)


### Bonus ###

# Write 3 functions, one for each approach.  Then, 
# Test how long it takes to perform each one 1000 times
